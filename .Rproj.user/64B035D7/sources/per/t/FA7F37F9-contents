Hi there! My name's Samir and I am currently a Business Intelligence Analyst at Bobcat. I launched my website back in 2023 to serve as my blog/portfolio. Feel free to take a look at my blog posts that are on the next tab. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me through any of my links on my home page.
