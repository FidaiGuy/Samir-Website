<p>This was a project that I undertook after Graduation in 2021. I downloaded my Twitter Data, extracted the tweets, and cut out the individual words. I then visualized the most commonly tweeted words using wordcloud2. The data below includes tweets all the way up to Mid-2021. I do plan on adding in an update for 2023.</p>
<p>In the chunk below, the tweets.js file is read into R</p>
