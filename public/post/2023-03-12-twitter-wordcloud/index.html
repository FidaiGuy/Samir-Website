<p><strong>UPDATE 3/29/2023: I have updated this project for tweets all the way up to March 13th, 2023</strong></p>
<p>This was a project that I undertook after Graduation in 2021. I downloaded my Twitter Data, extracted the tweets, and cut out the individual words. I then visualized the most commonly tweeted words using wordcloud2. The data below includes tweets all the way up to Mid-2021. I do plan on adding in an update for 2023.</p>
<p>In the chunk below, the tweets.js file is read into R</p>

<p>In the chunk below I counted each individual word and ordered it by number of occurences descending. The first Ten rows have been printed below.</p>
<p><strong>3/29: I filtered out gonna, which is slang for “Going To”. Going is a stop word and is filtered out. Wordle has also been filtered out. As much as how I enjoyed tweeting out my Wordle Scores, they were not tweets I tweeted but rather generated by the wordle share button.</strong></p>
